# Computing and GCD

## PREFACE
I had a general awareness of the impact of computer technology on design before to starting this course. This is in contrast to our regular use of Photoshop and other design applications, which is a more basic. However, I was unaware of this at the time. I interpreted it as an extremely difficult task, thus I was unable to begin. Fortunately, as a result of this week's study, I learned more about computer innovation and coding than I had previously, but I was also able to swiftly use this to improve my prior work. This has made me realise how important these technologies are to contemporary design.

## LEARING LOG
### Monday 11/08
+I preliminarily learned about creative computing in class with my classmates
+Draw a house with classmates to intuitively understand the open source.
+According to the guidance of resources, I learned physical computing on TinkerCAD.

### Tuesday
+Learned about readme file and tried to create it on GitHub.
+Try to edit readme file programmatically according to the instructions of basic syntax

### Thursday
``An important turning point in this learning process``

I discovered that the programming skills I acquired while making Multiple LEDs in TinkerCAD may be applied to achieve the objectives I was unable to achieve in the unit of <em>‘Type’</em>.

In that unit, the type of my research is 'input', a font designed for programming. And I learned that David Jonathan Ross, the author of this font, once said <em>:“For me, one of the most interesting parts of this typeface's development was the Cyrillic. I gave it a shot, but knowing I was no expert, decided to consult with Russian typeface designer Maria Doreuli. ”</em> As a result of this, and in order to honour his font design experience, I chose Tetris as one of the letter-drawing methods that is consistent with the font style.

However, at the time, my plan was to give them a PDF file with pictures and tables that I had prepared ahead of time so that they could practise spelling typefaces on their own. However, it appears to be stiff. I assumed that if I mastered  the Tetris programming technique, I would be able to express this font in a more exciting way and have a better understand of the input typeface developed for programming while utilising this programming. Now, this concept has now been preliminarily implemented.
After some research, I decided to develop the game using Scratch. This software's programming design panel and features are extremely similar to those of Tinkercad, which saves me time learning the basics. Then, using the courses I discovered online, I was able to made the prototype of the game.

## REFLECTION
After this week's study, I learnt a lot about creative computing and applied it to graphic design in a more consistent manner. I used to believe that classic graphic design and modern technologies should maintain their own qualities. The future, on the other hand, it can not be unrelated to the past. While both new technology and traditional design have distinct features, they can also help each other. The new technology can give design a fresh look, and we can also using design to make technology more dynamic, adding more "humanity."Just like I tried to improve the past design scheme with my new programming this week.
## FOR FUTURE LEARNERS
Contact with new things is always full of challenges. Sometimes you can get unexpected gains by doing something you don't want to do. Perhaps it is to let oneself reflect on the past work, or to have a clearer direction for the future.
